- [ModelCompare.ai](https://www.modelcompare.ai/?ref=eco-react-google-charts) - A platform that lets you easily explore and compare AI models side by side for free. If you're developing an AI application or simply curious about how different models perform, it's a great resource to check out. You can experiment with system prompts, adjust temperature settings, and even compare costs to see what fits your project best.

- Thanks to [Cube](https://cube.dev/?ref=eco-react-google-charts) for helping migrate the docs site to Docusaurus in 2021.
